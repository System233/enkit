// Get returns a directory name where to store data corresponding to key.
//
// key is a unique identifier for the data to be stored (or retrieved) from
// cache. It can be, for example, the URL for a large download, or the id
// of an object in a database.
//
// Get will return three parameters:
//    - the path to a directory, where to store or read the data corresponding
//      to this key.
//    - a boolean indicating if there was already a directory associated with
//      this key (true), or if a new directory was created from scratch (false).
//      When true, you should expect data previously stored to be ready and available
//      in the directory, but see below.
//    - an error, normally nil, indicating any error that happened while
//      trying to create this cached object.
//
// For a cache to be effective in an environment supporting parallel builds:
//    - only complete and usable artifacts should be stored in cache.
//    - data in cache should never be modified.
//
// To ensure both:
//    1) When using the cache, call Get()
//    2) If the data is there already, just use it.
//    3) If not there, download it, generate it, ... and store it directly in
//       the directory returned by Get().
//    4) Once the download, build, ... process is completed successfully, call
//       Commit(), described below. In case of error, call Purge().
//
// Between 3 and 4, the Local implementation guarantees that no other job will
// see the partial results being built or downloaded, the key will become available
// from cache (and results stored) only after Commit() is called.
//
// If you need to make changes to values in Local(), use Clone().

// When Get() encounters a key that was not in cache already, it returns a temporary

//
// It is recommended that Commit() is only called once the data to be cached has
// successfully been generated and verified - once it can be treated as a fully complete
// read only resource.
//
// If your code, however, can deal with inconsistent/incomplete data in cache, or
// with concurrent write access to data in a common shared directory, you can
// call Commit() immediately after Get().
//

// Purge removes and frees up the resources associated with a location generated by Get.
//
// Purge is used in two different cases:
//   1) To remove an existing entry from cache. Invoke Get for the key, pass the location
//      to Purge() to eliminate it from cache.
//   2) To remove any resource associated with a failed attempt at filling a cache entry.
//      Let's say Get() returned a new location. Your code is preparing data to be stored
//      in cache, but the build fails. To free up resources in this cache entry, call
//      Purge(location).
//
// Note that once a resource is Commit()ted, the location changes. So if Purge() is invoked
// on a resource just committed, it will just fail without doing anything.
// It is thus recommended that a defer c.Purge(location) is set up every time a new cache
// entry is being filled, like with:
//
//     location, ready, err := cache.Get("downloaded-libc")
//     if !ready {
//         defer cache.Purge(location)
//         // retry downloading file.
//         if err != nil {
//              return err // cache.Purge() will be invoked, and clean up.
//         }
//         cache.Commit(location)
//         // cache.Purge, when invoked by the defer, is now a noop.
